# Sample applications showed at 2023 presentation at Zlot Programist√≥w Delphi

[See slides from the talk](https://castle-engine.io/zlot2023/slides) (in Polish).

[See materials from other conferences where I presented CGE](https://castle-engine.io/conferences).

[Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/) is an open-source 3D and 2D game engine, with powerful visual editor and great object-oriented API using modern Pascal (Delphi and FPC).

Building:

- [Download Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

- Open the examples here in CGE editor and build it from CGE editor (or from Delphi IDE).

- To open `delphi_fmx` or `delphi_vcl`, you have to first register CGE packages and paths in Delphi IDE. See https://castle-engine.io/control_on_form .

See https://castle-engine.io/delphi for Delphi-specific information.
